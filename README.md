# SwiftXMLParserDemo

This is a demo for the [SwiftXMLParser](https://github.com/stefanspringer1/SwiftXMLParser).

Build with `swift build -c release`.

Give the path to an XML file as argument to the program and it prints infos about the parts of the XML document the parser finds.

Add the argument "-c" and the elements and all parse events are counted without further output.

Give a second path as second argument to the program and the XML document will be written to this second path.
